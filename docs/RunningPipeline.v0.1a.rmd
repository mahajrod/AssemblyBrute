# Ways to run

There are three ways to run the pipeline:

1. Run pipeline directly from source code. Setting of the environment (tools, databases and resources) is necessary.
This option theoretically allows to run pipeline on cluster or in cloud, but it was not tested.

2. Run pipeline packaged in docker container. Installation of container is necessary and is described in document
*DOCKER.pdf*. Tools, databases and resources are embedded in it.

3. Run pipeline packaged in docker via wrapper script **run_vgpsnake_docker.py**.
It simplifies and shortens the command necessary to run thr pipeline. Requirements are same as for previous cases.

# Installation of the docker container

First , you will have to install Docker itself. You could use the official instructions https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/ for your operating system.
Please, make sure that the  user you are going to use to run the pipeline is added to a docker group.
This step will require assistance of an IT team.
Next, you will need to download and install docker image of the pipeline
To unpack and install image run:

\begin{lstlisting}
docker image load -i vgpsnake.tar
\end{lstlisting}


# Quick start
## Minimal input


## Running the pipeline



# Same but with call of docker container via **run_vgpsnake_docker.py**




# Same but with direct call of docker container

# Pipeline inputs and settings
## Starting points


## Input files

## Modes
Pipeline could be run in several modes:

1. "full"              - full assembly pipeline






# Output files
## Structure of output directory
Pipeline stores all intermediate files including

\begin{lstlisting}
results/
